# About Me

Hello! My name is Sai Ghule and my pronouns are she/her. I am currently enrolled in the MISM-16 program at Carnegie Mellon University. This is my third degree, I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and a diploma in Underwater Archaeology before this.

As a career goal I aspire to be a Project/Product Manager. I'm looking forward to applying what I learn in this course to real-world projects and potentially pursuing a career in this area. Feel free to connect with me on [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-ghule999/](Linkedln)


# What I Hope to Learn

In this course, I am eager to learn 
- Data Visualisations
- Color Gradients
- Dashboards
- Tableau

I am particularly interested in understanding data and making visualisations better so that all can understand them, and I believe this course will provide me with the foundational skills to excel in this area. 

During my internship, I was responsible for creating Looker Studio Dashboards for a few complex projects, there I understood the importance of understanding data and the importance of elimination of redundant data and the impact good visualisations can have. I realised that you need to be good at visualizations as that is really important to stakeholders.
