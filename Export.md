### Step 1
- Locating the Dataset from [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/index.html)
  After trying to locate the data set from this website, I couldn't somehow find the correct dataset, so after trying this for a while I tried for alternative sources.
- Locating the Dataset from an existing public Tableau visualization
  Even this method did not work out as the tableau visualisation was downloadable but the dataset wasn't.
- Creating an account on [Data World](https://data.world.com) and then downloading the dataset from there
  I created a student account using my andrew id and I was able to download the dataset from here.




### Why this Dataset?
