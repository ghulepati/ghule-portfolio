- Locating the Dataset from [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/index.html)
  After trying to locate the data set from this website, I couldn't somehow find the correct dataset, so after trying this for a while I tried for alternative sources.
- Locating the Dataset from an existing public Tableau visualization
  Even this method did not work out as the tableau visualisation was downloadable but the dataset wasn't.
- Creating an account on [Data World](https://data.world.com) and then downloading the dataset from there
  I created a student account using my andrew id and I was able to download the dataset from here.



### Why this Dataset?

## Step 3 - Redesign

## Step 4 - Interviews

### Interview 1 
---
**Undergraduate Student**


   - **Can you tell me what do you see in the first 10 seconds when you see this visualization?**
     I see Red color, country names espcially Thailand
    I also see this has something to do with US arms export.
    
  - **Can you please describe what do you understand from this visualisation?**
    I think that Thailand has the most area and a prominent red color so it has the highest amount of imports from the US
    Size of the areas represent the volume of export and the color might represent something like top 3 countries or so.
    
  - **What particularly helped you understand the visualisation?**
    I think that title is self-explanatory. I also feel that the color scale is decent, as in red is a dominant color and thus it catches the eye
    I like the simplicity of the visualisation.
    
  - **What do you think should be improved?**
    This visualisation gives a feeling that Thailand is a huge country when it is not. It is a small country in terms of area whereas Canada is a pretty huge country.
    Probably a Map might help better in this aspect, just to see the size of the country vs it's import of arms
