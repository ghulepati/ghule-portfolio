# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience is my class professor, my class TA, my flatmate, my boyfriend, my mother who is always wishes for my well being, my father who calms her down, the woman for whom I opened the door today, the nice gentleman who said I looked beautiful in the morning, the not so nice person who thought I couldn't do xyz, the person who always believed in me even when I didn't. Yes, this list includes everyone, every human irrespective of their genders and sexual preferences around me and around all of us, as I think that being a woman, this beautiful rollercoaster journey is incomplete without everyone around us. The purpose of this story is not to point out at organizations or people who have themselves done for example gender pay discrimination or were victimes of, this is simply to educate people of the current scenario and making them think on their own if they want to do anything about it.

   of being a woman without getting into extremes?

   Yes, the story is suitable to explain to a child what it means to be a woman in today's world.

❓ What improvements will you suggest (Graphs, Design, Colors, Text)? What should the call of action be in the end according to you?  

**Answer**  

Graphs - Incorporate interactive graphs/visuals to further engage the audience in an interactable format.
Design - Balance the layout slightly better by utilizing the space available, to convey the maximum amount of data

The call to action should be to inspire the audience to interact with the topic on a deeper, more personal level. It should encourage everyone to promote initiatives such as gender equality and help enlighten the audience on women's issues, written by a woman. The call to action should inspire the reader to be more aware of the interactions around them and to be a force for good in this world.
