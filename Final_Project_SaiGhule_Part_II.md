# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience is my class professor, my class TA, my flatmate, my boyfriend, my mother who is always wishes for my well being, my father who calms her down, the woman for whom I opened the door today, the nice gentleman who said I looked beautiful in the morning, the not so nice person who thought I couldn't do xyz, the person who always believed in me even when I didn't. Yes, this list includes everyone, every human irrespective of their genders and sexual preferences around me and around all of us, as I think that being a woman, this beautiful rollercoaster journey is incomplete without everyone around us. The purpose of this story is not to point out at organizations or people who have themselves done for example gender pay discrimination or were victimes of, this is simply to educate people of the current scenario and making them think on their own if they want to do anything about it. 



## Interview script

❓ What do you understand by the title of this project? Can you guess the story structure from the title or does it leave you with various 
   different possibilities for this story?
   
❓ What is being a 21st century woman according to you?

❓ Are the visualizations easy to understand? If I give you 10 seconds per visualization, what all will you remember from them collectively? 
   Does it form a story structure in your head?
   
❓ If you were to explain what being a woman in this world is to a child, will this story work for the purpose? Does it cover various aspects 
   of being a woman without getting into extremes?

❓ What improvements will you suggest (Graphs, Design, Colors, Text)? What should the call of action be in the end according to you?
