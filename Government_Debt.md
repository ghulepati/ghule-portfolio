## Explanation - Tree Map Visualization 

This tree map visualization represents the general government debt of various countries. In this case, each rectangle represents a country, with the size of the rectangle corresponding to the total debt amount. 

### Concepts Used from class 

### 1. Limit Color and Eye Travel -
   
I have used a diverging orange-gold color scheme to better illustrate orange-brown color for countres like Japan who has the highest       government debt and then it lightens to yellow colors which shows countries with least debt. Initially there were 5 colors as recommended by Tableau but it felt like too much eye travel. Thus, I limited it to 3 colors from Brown-Orange(most debt), Orange(intermediate) and yellow(least debt).

### 2. Know how people think - 

After a few experimentation with blue, grey and lavender colors, I realised that orange-gold would be the best fit as usually red-orange is considerd a color of caution and while this is not entirely a visual for that, it does represent government debt, to which people will relate to because of the color. 

### 3. Why Tree Maps - 

Tree maps have the advantage of efficiently using space to display many data points simultaneously. In comparison to other visualization methods like bar charts or bubble charts, tree maps excel at showing the relative scale of many items at once. In this particular example, when we did the heat map for the same it could fit the location, year of time and value at the same time. But when I was exploring other data visualization options like bar chart or pie chart, the problem was that I was either able to do a location vs value or time vs value or similar graphs, when I tried all three at the same time, the graph would become caotic as the time period is long. So I came up with this tree map which visualizes location according to Median values (no particular reason for median over average). 

### 4. Innovation - 

Here, I have added a drop-down beneath the legend where one can select the year or multiple years for which they want to see the visualization. One can try using different combinations of years and see the area change and the colors change for different time periods which is interactive plus fun to visual governmant debt data!
