# Changes made since Part II

## Change in Story Structure 

It was mentioned in my comments and through my user research that the message was not potrayed through my stories, that the graphs were not fitting together. So I decided to change my story structure. 

### What I was initially doing - 

- Showing myself in a bubble of privilege
- I started with Rise in Female Directors
- Moving on with Gender Pay Gap
- Then a graph showing teen pregnancy

All of this together wasn't making a story and ***Call to Action*** wasn't clear because of this.

### Change I made - 

- I started with a positive change and showing some stats on how more and more women are enrolled in colleges and are getting degrees
  <img width="1103" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fba19a56-1648-439f-b845-9c235d7f10c6">
- At the same time, I contrasted this with a statement that though women enrollment is increasing, becausde of abortion laws in the US which     
  don't allow teenage girls to have an abortion, teen pregnancy rates are increasing due to which most of these girls drop out of school. I 
  tried to show the goood and bad, both sides of the coin at the same time.
  <img width="1137" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa729c2e-2ada-42cb-91a8-9809e8545b81">
- I supported this with my previous graph of increase in Teenage birth rate by state. Here, I didn't want to have a controversy by pointing out 
  abortion laws of each state thus, I choose to show teenage pregnancy rate by state to subtly indicate that the states with high teenage 
  pregnancy rates are the ones with unjust abortion laws and hence leading to a drop in education.
  <img width="940" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/084ad204-5cde-4ee4-8df1-059825f30bef">
- After this education sector, I moved on to professional sector and showed how there has been a rise of women leaders in business as compared 
  to male leaders.
- I supported this with a graph
  <img width="1394" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/915b0fed-5be5-4415-9c33-ffe6f40967dc">
- Now, again I wanted to show a contrast, thus while I am saying that women leaders are rising and it is a very good thing at the same time, for 
  a same position women are paid less than men even today and the gender pay gap exists and is very real. This graph is also present on 
  shorthand slides.
- After education and professional sector, I aimed at having some statistics from United Nations Women and other sources cited at the bottom, 
 showing how women from different locations around the world are forced to get married and once they are, they don't have the choice to make 
 their own decisions and while most of us have already fought the battle of education and professional sector, we loose here after being married 
 not according to our will.
- Call to Action 
  

## The audience

As I have described earlier as well in Part II, my audience is everyone. 

### What steps have I taken to make this audience understand better?

Initially with the teen pregnancy graph I had made a map and done some cool stuff (according to me) but it was really confusing and honestly people don't even liked to zoom in the map or take the effort to do so ..
Hence, I kept all of my graphs simple, a bar graph, a line graph and the last one simple lines showing difference between gender pay gap. I did this because, I want a high school dropout, a 80-year old person, man, woman, every human being irrespective of their gender and education level to understand my visualizations. 


## Final design decisions

I have talked above how I changed my entire story based on user interviews and comments I received.  

### Color Theme Changes 
- Initially I was going with lavender/purple/pink but then later after my slides were done I realised that, this is too steoreotypical and I dont want that. 


<img width="1190" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98dff8e0-2fc4-4536-9308-458060b72b16">

- After this I thought that I should make a bold move and go with blue showing bold gen-z women


<img width="1206" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/722ab29f-d1e5-4bf6-96bb-f381a73a3eec">

- After a long time thinking about all possible colors I know in life, it just hit me that why does have to be extreme, I mean my story doesn't say that being a woman is a good or bad thing in today's world, it is rather an educative approach towards it. So I decided to go with
  - Orange
  - Brown
  - Flowers
- This theme not only shows stability but also it doesn't stereotypes women to any colour, which is the motive of the story!

# Final thoughts

I honestly, loved working on this project. It all started when someone said to me that GHC is sexist and how in this bad job market women will get a job just because companies want diversity. Actually, it started way before this, all of my friends say that I am a strong feminist and sometimes I should chill a little, maybe that is true and I will take it chill when more than 50% teen girls don't drop out of school because of pregnancy, when women in high leadership positions get paid equally as men, when 41,000 girls per day under the age of 18 are not married!

When these numbers cease to exist, I will also stop being a strong feminist all the time, but till then I will continue to live in a beautiful postivie world with some anomalies trying to make it even more beautiful by educating people rather than going on a war with them, because that is what being a woman in 21st century is rigth? - We don't want you to sympathise with us, we don't want to wage a war against any gender(we really don't), we don't want you to feel sorry for us, all we want is for you to open your doors for us, so that we can educate you on how it is to be a woman and then it is your choice what to do with the information. That is what being a woman is, we give you a choice, a freewill to choose for yourself!
