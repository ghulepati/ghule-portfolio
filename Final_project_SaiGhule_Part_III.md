# Final Project Part III 

[Link to my Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/being-a-woman-in-the-21st-century/index.html)


# Changes made since Part II

## Change in Story Structure 

It was mentioned in my comments and through my user research that the message was not potrayed through my stories, that the graphs were not fitting together. So I decided to change my story structure. 

### What I was initially doing - 

- Showing myself in a bubble of privilege
- I started with Rise in Female Directors
- Moving on with Gender Pay Gap
- Then a graph showing teen pregnancy

All of this together wasn't making a story and ***Call to Action*** wasn't clear because of this.

### Change I made - 

- I started with a positive change and showing some stats on how more and more women are enrolled in colleges and are getting degrees
